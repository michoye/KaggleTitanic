## TODO

-   Split cabin

-   Think about imputation / try first imputation

-   Choice of pred model

## Log

### 2024-12-06

-   Data overview

-   Reformatting

## Setup

### Set of packages

```{r packages}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

if(!require("tidyverse")){
  install.packages("tidyverse")
  library("tidyverse")                                                       
  # packages that you’re likely to use in everyday data analyses: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, tibble, stringr, readr, forcats
}

if(!require("naniar")){
  install.packages("naniar")
  library("naniar")                                                          
  # assess and visualize missingness
}

if(!require("Hmisc")){
  install.packages("Hmisc")
  library("Hmisc")                                                          
  # assess and visualize missingness
}

if(!require("skimr")){
  install.packages("skimr")
  library("skimr")                                                          
}

if(!require("tidymodels")){
  install.packages("tidymodels")
  library("tidymodels")                                                          
  # modelling
}
```

### Load data

Load data with read.csv

```{r load}
train <- read.csv("data/train.csv")
test <- read.csv("data/test.csv")

# Example of what a submission file should look like
submission_example <- read.csv("data/gender_submission.csv")

train <- train |> 
  mutate(across(c("Survived", "Pclass", "Sex", "Embarked"), as.factor),
         Cabin = if_else(Cabin == "", NA, Cabin),
         Embarked = if_else(Embarked == "", NA, Embarked)) 
```

## Data inspection

```{r inspect}
train |> head()

train |> pull(Ticket) #what to the prefixes mean?
```

Structure of data frame

```{r inspect}
str(train)
```

```{r}
summary(train)
skim(train)
```

Histograms

```{r}
# Age in years
# Age is fractional if less than 1. 
# If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5
# Move age_estimated to new column ?
hist(train$Age)

# Passenger fare
hist(train$Fare, breaks = 50)

# Nr of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
# The dataset defines family relations in this way...
# Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
# Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)
hist(train$SibSp)

# Nr of parents / children aboard the Titanic
# The dataset defines family relations in this way...
# Parent = mother, father
# Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
# Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
hist(train$Parch)
```

Frequency tables

```{r}
# For data$Sex
table(train$Sex, useNA = "ifany")

# For data$Pclass - A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
table(train$Pclass, useNA = "ifany")

# For data$Embarked
table(train$Embarked, useNA = "ifany")

#for outcome (death)
table(train$Survived, useNA = "ifany")


```

Missing values

```{r}
gg_miss_var(train, show_pct = TRUE)


naplot(naclus(train))
```

## Data preprocessing

### Split cabin from room number

### Look at relationships cabin vs. class etc
