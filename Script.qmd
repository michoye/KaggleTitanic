# Set of packages

```{r packages, warning = F, message=F}
if(!require("tidyverse")){
  install.packages("tidyverse")
  library("tidyverse")                                                          # packages that you’re likely to use in everyday data analyses: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, tibble, stringr, readr, forcats
}

if(!require("naniar")){
  install.packages("naniar")
  library("naniar")                                                          # assess and visualize missingness
}

```

# Load data

Load data with read.csv

```{r load}
train <- read.csv("data/train.csv")
test <- read.csv("data/test.csv")

# Example of what a submission file should look like
submission_example <- read.csv("gender_submission.csv")
```

# Data inspection

```{r inspect}
train %>% head()
```

Structure of data frame

```{r inspect}
str(train)
```

```{r}
summary(train)
```

Histograms

```{r}
# Age in years
# Age is fractional if less than 1. 
# If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5
hist(train$Age)

# Passenger fare
hist(data$Fare)

# Nr of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic
# The dataset defines family relations in this way...
# Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
# Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)
hist(data$SibSp)

# Nr of parents / children aboard the Titanic
# The dataset defines family relations in this way...
# Parent = mother, father
# Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
# Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
hist(data$Parch)
```

Frequency tables

```{r}
# For data$Sex
table(train$Sex, useNA = "ifany")

# For data$Pclass - A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
table(train$Pclass, useNA = "ifany")

# For data$Embarked
table(train$Embarked, useNA = "ifany")
```

Missing values

```{r}
gg_miss_var(train, show_pct = TRUE)
```

# Data preprocessing
